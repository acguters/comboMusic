This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##if that's too confusing to run, tbh just use the actions below

-Download the zip file or clone repo on desktop
-Angular requires Node.js, so you need to download that as well(https://nodejs.org/en/)
-Optional: I used Visual Studio Code to create this project
-go to project folder and run the following commands:
  -'npm install' (installs necessary files for angular)
  -after it is installed, run 'npm start' to start the server
  -host is localhost:4200
-NOTE: You will need a spotify account in order to run this app
